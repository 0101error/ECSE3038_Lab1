# ECSE3038_Lab1 - Python Functions

This repository contains Python code for Lab 1 of ECSE3038, focusing on practicing Python, Git, and GitHub.

## Functions Implemented

Question 1- `parallel(resistances)`
The effective resistance of a network of parallel resistors is computed and printed by this function. Its input is a list of resistor values.

Question 2- `potential_divider(voltage_supply, series_resistances)`
The voltage drop between each resistor in a series circuit (potential divider) is computed and printed by this function. Its inputs are a list of series resistor values and the voltage source.

Question 3- `temperature_check(temperature, unit)`
In order to ascertain whether a patient is hypothermic, hyperthermic, or has a normal temperature, this function measures the patient's body temperature. It accepts as inputs the temperature and the unit ('C' or 'F').

## Purpose

As part of the ECSE3038 lab assignment, this code was produced to show that the author understood how to create Python functions and to experience using GitHub and Git for version control.

## Short Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode?

Because light attracts bugs!
